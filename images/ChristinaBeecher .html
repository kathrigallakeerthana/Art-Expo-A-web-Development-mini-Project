                AFTER SPENDING NEARLY 2O YEARS IN THE DESIGN WORLD, CHRISTINA CHANGED ARTISTIC DIRECTION AND BEGAN TO PAINT. AWESTRUCK BY THE LANDSCAPE, SHE HAS COME TO STUDY ITS EVER-CHANGING QUALITIES THAT MAKE IT SO UNIQUE
-ARTIST STATEMENT.
COLOR, LIGHT AND VALUE ARE THE ELEMENTS I VALUE MOST IN MY WORKS.  THEY SERVE AS A BACKDROP TO REINFORCE MY COMPOSITIONS OF MY LANDSCAPES.SINCE MY LANDSCAPES ARE NOT A TRUE REPRESENTATION OF ANY REAL PLACE,BUT INSTEAD,OF MANY
PLACES AND FROM MY OWN IMAGINATION,IT IS MY HOPE THAT THESE VISUALS CAN LEND THEMSELVES TO AN AWARENESS OF ONEâ€™S SENSIBILITY IN RELATION TO THE NATURAL WORLD.BESIDES WORKING ON HER OWN WORK,SHE ADVISES HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AS 
THEY APPLY FOR COLLEGES, TEACHES PRIVATE LESSONS INS HER HOME STUDIO, AND DOES WORKSHOPS AND DEMOS FOR MANY ORGANIZATIONS.  PLEASE INQUIRE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ANY OF THESE THINGS.SHE IS ALSO A MEMBER AND A TRUSTEE OF THE 
ATTLEBORO ARTS MUSEUM, WHERE SHE DOES EVERYTHING FROM PAINTING WALLS TO LIGHTING EXHIBITS.SHE IS ALSO A MEMBER OF OIL PAINTERS OF AMERICA.
