                Arghavan Khosravi (b. 1984, Shahr-e Kord, Iran), lives and works in Stamford, Connecticut.

Khosravi’s studio practice mobilizes visual art as a vehicle for cultural transformation.She investigate the aesthetics of ancient Persian miniature paintings, which were originally used to illustrate folkloric texts.Typically,the only women 
they portray have a subservient or secondary role,lacking agency and social significance.Khosravi’s paintings take a conscious look at how the value system transmitted by that iconography continues to shape Iranian gender politics today.The 
most noticeable visual characteristic of Khosravi’s paintings is their multi-dimensionality.Constructed from a complex scaffolding of cut and painted wooden panels, they offer a constantly shifting perceptual experience.Visual motifs such as
black plumes, rockets, and cages reference corrupted economic and political systems, while female bodies are often depicted as being shackled or with their mouths sewn shut.Arghavan Khosravi earned an MFA in painting from the Rhode Island 
School of Design after completing the studio art program at Brandeis University.Khosravi previously earned a BFA in Graphic Design from Tehran Azad University and an MFA in Illustration from the University of Tehran. She has exhibited both 
nationally and internationally in solo exhibitions.She is a 2019 recipient of the Joan Mitchell Foundation’s Painters & Sculptors Grant and a 2017 recipient of the Walter Feldman Fellowship.
