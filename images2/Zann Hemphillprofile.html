                Zann Hemphill does amazing portraits. She always wanted to do her own thing, and was always making art with animals, and then one day the two just kind of clicked.Running a pet portrait
                business was a manageable thing to start, even with zero budget and only a small shared apartment to work out of.And unlike a lot of other business options,it totally meshed with her art 
                background from Emily Carr.After initially investing only a few hundred dollars in a website and some advertising,she made her first sale! That was back in 2017.After a few months testing
                the waters, she quit her full-time job to work on Paws By Zann,and started getting more clients.Now Zann has a dedicated studio space and has done hundreds of paintings for people,not just
                dogs and cats. Sometimes birds and horses and hedgehogs appear. These last two years she’s focused a ton on improving her use of value in her art,practicing painting from life with anything 
                or anyone available. The studio is filled with sketches of Peaches and Tiberius, her St. Bernard and tabby cat—mostly while they’re napping.
